After: ![](http://i.cubeupload.com/Gk7hR6.png)


### Expanded Hotkeys

Extends the vanilla hotkeys system a little:

- Enables adding immediate/prioritised build queues (control key by default).
- Clear build queue(s) while allowing already started units to finish.
- Filter selection by unit type.
- Toggle chronocam.
- Also removes the annoying prompt when deleting units & structures.
- Makes the ammo group accessible.


### No splash

Hides the splash screen when launching the game. So you can get back to playing quicker.


### Fabricator commander
Adds the commander to the fabricator grouping, so it's included in idle alerts and idel fabricator selecting.

### Don't Look at me!

Stops the camera from moving over and zooming on the commander when spawning.


### Continuous build stance

If a selection consists of only idle factories, set them to continuous build stance.


### Betterer system view

Adds metal indicators to the system panel.
